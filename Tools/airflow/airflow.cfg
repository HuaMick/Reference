Reset and upgrade the airflow database
    airflow db reset
    airflow db upgrade

The first time you run Airflow, it will create a file called ``airflow.cfg`` in
your ``$AIRFLOW_HOME`` directory (``~/airflow`` by default). This is in order to make it easy to
"play" with airflow configuration.

However, for production case you are advised to generate the configuration using command line:

        airflow config list --defaults

airflow.cfg
    load_examples: "false"
    dags_folder: path to dags_folder
