Column-oriented: Unlike CSV files that store data row by row, Parquet stores data by column. This makes it faster to read specific columns needed for analysis, instead of the entire file.
Efficient compression: Parquet compresses data well, reducing storage space and speeding up data transfer.
Open-source and popular: Parquet is an open-source format compatible with many data processing tools, making it a popular choice for big data workflows.
